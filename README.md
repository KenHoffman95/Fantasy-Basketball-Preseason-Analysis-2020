# Fantasy-Basketball-Preseason-Analysis-2020

# Introduction
In anticipation for the 2020-2021 Fantasy Basketball season, I decided to evaluate each NBA player in order to build a ranking of the players by their fantasy basketball value. I used the 11 statistics (FG%, FT%, 3PM, REB, AST, BLK, STL, TOV, PTS, Double-Doubles, Tripe-Doubles)  that are most commonly used as fantasy basketbal categories in order to build the player rankings. 

# Objective
Perform analysis of NBA player statistics from the 2019-2020 season in order to build a ranking of NBA players by their 2020-2021 fantasy basketball value.

# Dataset
In order to analyze each NBA player's statistics from the 2019-2020 season, I pulled the data from https://www.basketball-reference.com/. The original dataset contains 528 players; all having played minutes in the NBA during the 2019-2020 season. I then removed the players that didn't play meaningful minutes and ended up with a datset of 502 players.
