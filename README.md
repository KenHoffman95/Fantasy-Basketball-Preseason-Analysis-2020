# Fantasy-Basketball-Preseason-Analysis-2020

# Introduction
In anticipation for the 2020-2021 Fantasy Basketball season, I decided to evaluate each NBA player in order to build a ranking of the players by their fantasy basketball value. I used the 11 statistics (FG%, FT%, 3PM, REB, AST, BLK, STL, TOV, PTS, Double-Doubles, Tripe-Doubles)  that are most commonly used as fantasy basketbal categories in order to build the player rankings. 
# Objective
Perform analysis of NBA player statistics from the 2019-2020 season in order to build a ranking of NBA players by their 2020-2021 fantasy basketball value.
